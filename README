The DAGFrameScheduler is a Multi-Threaded lock free and wait free scheduling library designed for use in video games.

Currently this is not ready for most production use but is ready for peer review and possibly for integration into simple games.

This is licensed under the GPL v3 license as per the file 'LICENSE'.

 -- NEWS --
	Dec 9, 2012
		Added an example Asynchronous File loading workunit that seems to perform near the peak capacity of the hardware I tested it on. Also a little bit of documentation cleanup.

	Dec 7, 2012
		Removed friendships between WorkUnit and FrameScheduler (Some core algorithm classes keep this though).
		Separated the WorkUnits Implementation from its interface. I did not do this with the other work units, it seems that this will satisfy most customization needs along with changing the inheritance of the other workunits.

	Dec 6, 2012
		Removed all occurrences of volatile keyword.
		Added a Barrier synchronization class.

	Dec 4, 2012
		Fixed a scheduling issue which caused a thread to stall on a specific workunit if it had unment dependencies.
		Test for thread affinity emits manually checkable contents and passes manual inspection.
		I found a bug with the the 'threadrestart' test, where it sometimes runs all wokunits on one thread. This is not ideal, but it is valid, I have found a way to fix this, but it will take time to implement.

	Dec 3, 2012
		Simplified parameter passing to WorkUnits now they only recieve one ThreadSpecific storage.
		Re-worked pause timing algorithm to make it more simple. Logically it just carries a portion of any amount it was off into the next frame.
		Updated documentation. I have started a small project attempt to read/revise every piece of doxygen docs going over each file alphabetically to and I am at framescheduler.h.

	Dec 2, 2012
		Fixed warnings in Mingw, clang and VS2012. 0 warnings in any of these compilers at this moment and it passes tests in windows/linux with these compilers where applicable.
		Removed integer overflow in some places where the results of GetTimeStamp() were assigned to datatypes smaller than 64 bit.


	Dec 1, 2012
		Enabled all build warnings, and corrected them in GCC.
		Updated the way unit tests are run to allow the isolated of execution of one test or all the tests at once. Fixed Framerate calculation bugs in performane tests.

	Nov 30, 2012
		Created a single point at which to update all the creation of double buffered resources. The goal is to make changing this easy if another project wants to add double buffered resources to each thread.
		Added WorkUnit affinity. A special way to add WorkUnits so that they will be scheduled with the rest of the WorkUnits, but only executed on the main thread.
		More Documentation updates.

	Nov 29, 2012
		Documentation updates.

	Nov 28, 2012
		Bugfixes with workunit sorting and a simple performance test has been added.

	Nov 27, 2012
		Removed Bi-Directionality from Dependency Graph. At their largest WorkUnits are now 56 bytes. This was done so that they would fit in a single cache line on most systems. This also speeds up adding or removing WorkUnits. When the information the Reverse dependency graph needed is required a temporary cache is updated on the scheduler itself. When this depedent (no cy) graph is updated the WorkUnitKeys used for sorting the work are also updated. This can done with calls to FrameScheduler::UpdateDependencyCache and can be control with a bool argument passed in to FrameScheduler::SortWorkUnits().

		Verified support for Mac OS X. Now this compiles on Mac os X 10.6.8 with GCC 4.2.1, Ubuntu x64 with GCC 4.3.2 or Clang 3.0.6-6, or on windows xp with MinGW or visual studio 10.
		Timing test on Mac OS X and Linux both have submicrosecond accuracy, and they both provide 1 microsecond times, winxp does not, but this is still accurate on the order of 1000s of microseconds, and the timer is usually about that accurate.
